# Overview
This is just a simple repository I'm using to study game programming concepts and dive deeper into C++. This isn't necessarily meant for public use, and I can't guarantee it will work for your system.

# Building

Requirements:
- cmake
- make

Steps:
- clone this repository
- running `generate.sh` will target Unix operating systems. Run `cmake -G <build target>` with a different `build target` associated with your operating system (if you choose to use cmake).
- running `make` will compile and dump a binary in  `<repository>/bin`.
